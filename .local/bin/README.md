# Various useful scripts written by me or lifted from someone else ;).

# autostart

Script that starts all the programs I need while running X. It is called by dwm while starting up. It is a much more elegant solution than the autostart patches in dwm.

# battery_notify.py && brightness_notify.py

Python scripts lifted from Benedikt Vollmerhaus' repo. Do what they say on the tin.

# bin2hex

Tomasz Ostrowski (tomeko)'s binary to hexadecimal converter program.
Kept here so I can easily find it and in case it goes down.

# calnotify

Script to notify appointments and todo of calcurse.
Used as a cronjob to run periodically every 15 minutes.

# dmenuunicode

Luke Smith's script for inserting emojis in st.

## dmenumount && dmenuumount

Luke Smith's scripts to mount/unmount both USB and Android devices.

# dmtpfs

[Update]: No longer in use, in favour of dmenumount and dmenuumount
Brodie Robertson's Android automount script.

# fehbg

Script that set's the wallpaper using feh.

# launchpolybar

Script that does what it says on the tin. Not used anymore, as I don't use polybar.
# mailsync

Script created my me, and partly inspired by Luke Smith's script of the same name.
Syncs my email, sends a notification telling how many new emails, as well as who they are from, and the subject.

# mw

My copy of Luke Smith's mutt-wizard script, before the "big redesign". This older version allows me to keep the mbsync file in .config/isync, which is where it should be. The newer mw doesn't allow this and keeps it in ~, which I hate.

# scratch

[Update]: No longer in use, as I use dwm, and it has a inbuilt implementation/better implementation through a patch.

Script to imitate i3's scratchpad feature in bspwm. Used to hold my music player in the scratchpad.

# shutdmenu

Script to create a shutdown menu using dmenu.
Options are: logout, restart X, reload sxhkd, shutdown, reboot and lock X.

# thinkpoint

Script that enables the various settings of my ThinkPad's TrackPoint, like Press to Select, Speed and Sensitivity.

# tnot

Script that hooks into my rtorrent config to notify when a torrent has finished downloading.
